You can see the project hosted live at: https://jonibach.github.io/stellify-media/

__In Brief:__ 

This is a project made to demonstrate my Front End development ability in React JS (aimed at mobile users). Made over the course of a couple evenings, stellify media showcases a variety of modern techniques that make UI development such an amazing field to be working in!

## Where could we go next?

__If I had more time, I would...__

1. Impliment a tool to calcualte the viewing stats using react contexts (i would have done this but ran out of time)

2. Add a Like/dislike counter to the media

3. Add a comments section

4. Mock a login user with personalised messages 

5. Test with Jest and Enzyme
